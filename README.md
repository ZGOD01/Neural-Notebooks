# Neural Notebooks

Welcome to the **Neural Notebooks** repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks documents my hands-on journey through the [GeeksforGeeks Deep Learning Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning-tutorial/). It encompasses foundational concepts, data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and practical implementations of various neural network architectures.

## üìö Course Overview

The GeeksforGeeks Deep Learning course offers a comprehensive introduction to deep learning, covering topics such as:

- Understanding neural networks and their components
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory data analysis techniques
- Building and training neural network models
- Applications of deep learning in real-world scenarios



## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Data Reading.ipynb`: Techniques for reading and importing datasets.
- `Dealing with Missing Values.ipynb`: Methods to handle missing data effectively.
- `Dealing with Duplicate Data.ipynb`: Approaches to identify and remove duplicate entries.
- `EDA - Understanding your data.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights from data.
- `Bivariate Analysis numerical-categorical.ipynb`: Analysis between numerical and categorical variables.
- `Bivariate Visualizations (Categorical).ipynb`: Visualizing relationships between categorical variables.
- `GroupBy in Pandas.ipynb`: Utilizing groupby operations for data aggregation.
- `Matplotlib.ipynb`: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib.
- `Inventory Management.ipynb` & `Inventory Management - JSON Overview.ipynb`: Managing inventory data and working with JSON files.
- `Data Analysis using Conditions.ipynb`: Conditional data analysis techniques.
- `Data Analysis with Multiple Columns.ipynb`: Analyzing data across multiple columns.

Datasets used:
